|----------------|-------------------|
| **Bias**        | Gender, race, age, political, religious stereotypes |
| **Ethics**      | Privacy, harm, autonomy, deception |
| **Transparency**| Hidden sources, overconfidence, lack of explainability |
| **Fairness**    | Unequal treatment, outcomes, or access |

Analysis uses keyword/pattern matching based on ethical principles and known risk indicators.
